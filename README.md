To keep it simple I created some bash scripts to quickly and easily setup a root CA and intermediate CA  
These scripts will ask questions and build the json files for you executing the necessary CFSSL

## Requirements
Install CFSSL https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl  
MacOS or Linux system with Bash
